This project addresses some of the major problems surrounding planning and preparing meals.
One such problem is the problem of monotony when it comes to cooking. People are indecisive about what meals to cook, or unaware of the possible meals that can be prepared given what is in their pantry. This can lead to a lack of cooking variety as people stick to cooking a few meals they are comfortable with. To address this problem, this application recommends multiplepossible meals to prepare given the ingredients one owns, or the type of food one is interested in.

Another problem is ignorance or disregard of health and nutrition information when it comes to cooking. People are unaware of the health/nutrition information for the food they prepare - often because nutrition information is too much of a pain to keep track of.
To address this problem, this application provides clear and consolidated nutrition information for each recommended meal.

Another problem that this project addresses is the lack of clarity of where to shop before cooking a meal. People often want to cook a meal that is new to them, but they do not know where to shop for the proper ingredients.

To address this problem, this application recommends nearby stores that sell the proper ingredients for a given meal.
